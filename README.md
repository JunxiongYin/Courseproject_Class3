# Courseproject_Class3

This is the final project for the third course in data science specialization in Coursera, Getting and Cleaning data.

There are mainly R script for cleaning the data, and CodeBook for detailed explanation of the process. 

Basically, we first combine the test and train data sets. Then we extract certain columns to do further analysis. To make the column names interpretable, we revise it by removing unnecessary parenthesis and changing ways of abbreviation. We also substitute numbers with actual types of activities to make the data easier to understand. Finally, we summarize the data by averaging each variable over each activity and each subject, and the result can be found in tidydt.txt.
